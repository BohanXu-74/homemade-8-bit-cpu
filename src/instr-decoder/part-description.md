Im working on this too thanks for the patience! :)

Demo Video above!

## Info

This part of the CPU handles everything. THIS IS THE BRAIN of the Brain.

Im using a ROM as the deocder and I'm also using microcode.

Here's the microcode and instruction set:

[See the instruction set](../../docs/instr.txt)

Theres also a file to the actual data in the ROM if you know how to use Digital you can probably read it, otherwise ask chatgpt or somthin.
